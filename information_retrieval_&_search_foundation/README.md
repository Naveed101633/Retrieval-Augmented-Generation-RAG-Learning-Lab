# Retriever Architecture (High-Level Overview)

_In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, the retriever is responsible for finding the most relevant documents for a given user prompt.

When a prompt is received, it is first sent to the retriever, which searches a knowledge base (a collection of documents) and returns the best matches to be passed to the LLM.

## Core Retrieval Techniques

Modern retrievers typically use **three complementary techniques**.

---

### Keyword Search

Keyword search retrieves documents that contain the **exact words** from the user’s prompt.

* Precise and fast
* Sensitive to exact wording
* Limited when documents use different phrasing

---

### Semantic Search

Semantic search retrieves documents based on **meaning**, not exact wording.

* Uses embeddings and vector similarity
* Finds relevant documents even when wording differs
* More flexible than keyword search

---

### Metadata Filtering

Metadata filtering removes documents that do not meet **strict criteria**, such as:

* department
* access level
* document type

This step ensures only **allowed and relevant** documents are considered.

## Hybrid Search

In practice, retrievers combine these techniques:

1. Run keyword search.
2. Run semantic search.
3. Apply metadata filters.
4. Merge and re-rank results.
5. Return the top relevant documents.

This approach is called **hybrid search**.
